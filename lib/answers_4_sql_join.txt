Checkpoint 4 Where, Order, and Join
Assignment Question Number 3
3.	Write a SQL query using the professor/department/compensation data
 	that outputs the average number of vacation days by department:
	example output:
		department_name
		average_vacation_days

			----------
		Transfiguration             2.0
		Defence Against…	9.0
		Study of Ancient…	8.0
		Care of Magical…	13.0

              To do this, explore the SQL docs and research SQL features
	 not covered in chkpoint like GROUP_BY and avg()

MY SOLUTION:
SELECT department.department_name AS department_name,
AVG(compensation.vacation_days) AS average_vacation_days
FROM professor
JOIN department ON professor.department_id = department.id
JOIN compensation ON professor.id = compensation.professor_id
GROUP BY professor.department_id;

TO TEST:
at dot prompt
sqlite3
.open hogwarts
.headers on
.mode column
...select statement from above

RESULTS:

department_name  average_vacation_days
--------------- ----------------------
Transfiguration  2.0
Defence Against  9.0
Study of Ancien  8.0
Care of Magical  13.0
